## Problem

Forests are crucial to the health of our planet. They store carbon dioxide and mitigate the effects of extreme weather conditions such as storms or heavy rainfall. Nevertheless, large areas of forest are lost every day to legal and illegal deforestation. In addition, climate change is affecting forest health in many parts of the world. For this reason, administrations and forest owners need up-to-date information on changes in forest cover to take action against illegal logging and make forests more resilient to climate change. 

## Solution

The Forest Monitoring and Adaptation to Climate Change combines data from ESA’s Sentinel 1 and 2 satellites with LIDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) measurements and AI to provide near real-time monitoring of forests at small and large scale. Specialised algorithms simplify the identification of individual trees and the determination of their species, protection status, height. This gives forest owners an easily accessible overview of the condition of their forest and helps to prevent illegal logging. In addition, the information can be used to monitor the growth of newly planted ones.

## Services

Forest monitoring and adaptation service covers the entire area of Lithuania and is focused regular detection of large and small patches of forest cover loss, measured by change detection of Sentinel-1 SAR signal change detection. This service is capable of automatic and objective detection of all potential sites where possible loss of trees took place. The smallest object detected by the service is 10x10m (1 pixel), and there are no specific filters applied to eliminate single pixels. The most valuable part of forest monitoring and adaptation service is regular update of statistical values of potential forest loss on the level of a single forest taxation plot, which is a minimum mapping unit of the forest cover used as a framework for all forestry planning and management activities. This service detects not only large clear-cuts, but also illegal logging sites and even large tree falls all over the county with precise geo-tagging on the most detailed forestry map.

Regional mapping of the actual tree cover loss (including clear-cuts and natural events) is based on polarimetry SAR signal change detection between two consequent sampling periods. As most of the forest clear-cut or tree cover loss sites are relatively small (less than 10 ha), those objects - although quite abundant - are practically invisible on a small scale of a regional map. Therefore we introduced an additional layer of points marking the locations of detected forest cover loss sites with additional attribute of approximate object size, which was used as numeric parameter to represent relative size of a clear-cut on a regional map and helt to navigate further by zooming to the actual forest cover loss locations while zooming the map, as shown in the following examples.

## About

The Baltic GTIF activity is part of the Green Transition Information Factory, an initiative supported by the European Space Agency that fosters innovative services based on Earth Observation for climate and energy transition.
Forest Monitoring and Adaptation to Climate Change capability is developed and delivered by Coetus which is responsible for service development, design, data processing, visualization and analytics. The cloud infrastructure and integration for advanced applications are provided by EOX IT Services. Both partners contribute extensive expertise in Earth Observation, geospatial analytics and user focused digital services.

## Subscriptions
 
The Forest Monitoring and Adaptation to Climate Change (FMAC) service is offered as a subscription service with flexible conditions depending on the size of the area, the update frequency and the preferred mode of delivery. Agencies and municipalities can subscribe to dashboard access, to API integration, or to regular report delivery according to their requirements.
A free demonstration version of the FMAC service is available for selected pilot cities. Further pre-commercial demonstration projects may apply for sponsorship through the ESA Network of Resources. This enables municipalities to evaluate the service without or reduced initial investments.
Optional features include custom dashboards adjusted to user key performance indicators, automated reporting routines, and advanced visualization tools to support communication with stakeholders and citizens.
