## Problem

Climate change increases the frequency and severity of extreme weather events. Agricultural land is particularly susceptible to damage caused by summer storms. Strong winds and heavy rainfall are the main reason for drasic yield losses due to crop lodging and drowning. Soft ground caused by flooding can also restrict access to fields. To analyse the impact of extreme weather events on agricultural production, insurance companies and farmers need precise information on the locations and severity of crop damage and the level of soil moisture in specific fields. 

## Solution

The Climate-Resilient Food Production Systems uses SAR data from ESA’s Sentinel 1A satellite to provide users with information on crop damage per plot and access restrictions for heavy machinery due to wet ground. New algorithms enable the automatic detection and evaluation of crop lodging as well as the calculation of soil moisture indices. The information can be used to accurately quantify crop losses and analyse the profitability of farming certain fields in view of the expected consequences of climate change.

## Service

Climate-resilient and sustainable food production systems services include two capabilities: detection and monitoring of crop flooding events (including regular spring floods) and detection of crop lodging (dumping) by extreme weather conditions like extreme storms with strong winds and hail. Crop flooding analysis is based on monthly statistics derived from full time series of Sentinel-1 data and covers three scenarios: (1) high moisture level lasting for ~1/3 duration of the month, (2) medium moisture level lasting for ~1/2 duration of the month and (3) low moisture level lasting for ~2/3 duration of the month. All three scenarios are summarised in separate layers of per-parcel flooding maps.

Detection of crop lodging is based on change detection threshold values computed from Sentinel-1 polarimetry SAR statistics sampled during decades 1-10 and 20-30. Analysis was performed only on winter and spring cereals, which are most vulnerable to crop lodging. Percentage of area indicating crop dumping (including severe cases of lodging) was summarised on the level of single parcels.

## About

The Baltic GTIF activity is part of the Green Transition Information Factory, an initiative supported by the European Space Agency that fosters innovative services based on Earth Observation for climate and energy transition.
The Climate-Resilient Food Production Systems’ capability is developed and delivered by Geomatrix which is responsible for service development, design, data processing, visualization and analytics. The cloud infrastructure and integration for advanced applications are provided by EOX IT Services. Both partners contribute extensive expertise in Earth Observation, geospatial analytics and user focused digital services.

## Subscriptions

The Climate-Resilient Food Production Systems’ (CRFPS) service is offered as a subscription service with flexible conditions depending on the size of the area, the update frequency and the preferred mode of delivery. Agencies and municipalities can subscribe to dashboard access, to API integration, or to regular report delivery according to their requirements.
A free demonstration version of the CRFPS service is available for selected pilot cities. Further pre-commercial demonstration projects may apply for sponsorship through the ESA Network of Resources. This enables municipalities to evaluate the service without or reduced initial investments.
Optional features include custom dashboards adjusted to user key performance indicators, automated reporting routines, and advanced visualization tools to support communication with stakeholders and citizens.
