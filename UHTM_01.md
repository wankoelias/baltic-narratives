## Hot town - Summer in the city
Prolonged periods of extremely high temperatures, known as heat waves, are among the most serious effects of climate change, with record temperatures occurring with increasing frequency. Built-up urban areas and cities are particularly vulnerable to such heat waves: almost half of the approximately 10,000 cities worldwide have been exposed to increased heat over the past four decades [[1]](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/jrc-news-and-updates/urban-heat-islands-managing-extreme-heat-keep-cities-cool-2024-07-22_en).
Heat in cities has long-term effects that go beyond temporary discomfort, posing lasting challenges for cities and their residents. Prolonged exposure to high temperatures increases chronic health risks such as cardiovascular, respiratory, and kidney disease, and affects mental well-being. This particularly affects vulnerable groups such as the elderly, children and also people who are particularly exposed to heat due to outdoor work.
Rising temperatures amplify air pollution, strain water and energy resources, and accelerate environmental degradation. Over time, these effects deepen social inequalities, as low-income 
households are disproportionately affected because they are more likely to live in older, poorly insulated buildings located in areas with less green space, more sealed surfaces and higher building density.

## Living on an island
Cities heat up more than their rural surroundings due to the urban heat island effect, whereby concrete, asphalt, and dense development absorb and store heat far more than natural landscapes. Street canyons further amplify this effect by reduced air circulation and increased reflection of solar radiation between buildings. The lack of trees, parks, and bodies of water reduces natural cooling, while cars, air conditioning, and industry further heat up the environment. As a result, temperatures in urban areas can be several degrees higher than in surrounding rural areas, especially at night when heat is slowly released from buildings and roads. 
Even within the urban area, the intensity of heating varies depending on the degree of sealing on the one hand and the proportion of green and water areas on the other. Therefore, the health impact during heat waves in cities can vary considerably from place to place.
The monitoring of urban heat trends helps cities to track temperature changes over time and to identify the most vulnerable neighbourhoods. By collecting this data, policymakers and planners can develop targeted cooling strategies, such as planting trees, creating green roofs, or adapting building materials. Such monitoring also supports public health measures to enable early heat warnings for particularly affected areas and better protection for vulnerable groups and to initiate short-term and temporary measures during heat waves.

## We built this city
Different stakeholders can use the knowledge gained from urban heat trend monitoring to make their city or district more resilient and liveable:
* Urban planners and policymakers have a basis for designing cooler and more resilient urban environments. 
* Health authorities and emergency services need this knowledge to prepare for heat waves and protect vulnerable populations. 
* Architects, engineers, and construction companies should be aware of local temperature trends to select and use appropriate materials that absorb less heat.
* Residents and community groups benefit from this awareness, as local measures such as planting trees or creating green roofs can help reduce heat in the neighbourhood.

## How will I know?
Satellite data helps to monitor urban heat trends by measuring land surface temperatures (LST) using thermal infrared sensors, thereby providing a picture of heat distribution in cities.
Satellites provide a consistent, large-scale coverage that enables comparisons between different neighbourhoods, cities and even countries. Moreover, the data can be used to track changes over time and show how urban planning measures affect local temperatures.

The **Urban Heat Trend Monitor** (UHTM) service  provides a collection of tools for displaying heat distribution within a city in high resolution, determining heat trends over several years, and calculating and displaying urban areas with the same heat trend, enabling local hotspots to be identified quickly and intuitively. For each of these areas, a detailed time series analysis can be retrieved, enabling identification of patterns and extremes over the entire period as well as for specific periods of the year (e.g. summer). The UHTM service processes its results based on satellite data provided by Copernicus, the European Union’s Earth observation program [[2]](https://www.copernicus.eu). It combines data from ESA's Copernicus Sentinel 2 and 3 satellites with Open Street Map features to provide users with easy-to-interpret maps of urban climate information. Super-resolution imaging is used to enhance the resolution of the satellite instruments to a scale of 100 metres allowing the analysis of heat islands and temperature fluctuations at the level of individual neighbourhoods.

## Finally
The **Urban Heat Trend Monitor** service has been developed by OHB Digital Connect as part of the BalticGTIF project within the priority domain **Sustainable Cities** of ESA’s **Green Transition Information Factory (GTIF)** programme [[3]](https://gtif.esa.int).
