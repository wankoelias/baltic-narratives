## Problem & Needs

Nature is our primary asset, while natural and semi-natural ecosystems reflect back how humans implement land use. Ecosystems are tolerating and changing; but they do present complex services. Earth observation offers various measuring methods \- with objectivity and repeatability \- to detect the reactions and changes of ecosystems. Our ambition is to present models capable of estimating the impact of the detected ecosystem service changes.       
The current  geospatial analytics dashboard presents the assessment of extensive High Nature Value Grassland as part of agricultural landscapes in  Lithuania as a pilot use case for the Baltic States. 

Natural grasslands  in Lithuania (and further European countries) are currently under pressure due to intensified food production and the conversion of permanent grasslands (PG) into arable land (AL). As the availability of former Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) land is insufficient to meet the new production demand and/or it is more profitable, farmers increasingly plough their grassland parcels based on logistic-driven decisions, without evaluating the ecosystem services of a particular agricultural parcel soil health, buffer capacity, ecosystem connectivity and biodiversity. However and notably, old meadows and biodiversity-rich grasslands: 

* can store up to 320t CO2E/hectare of which a larger proportion will be emitted due to ploughing while restoration takes up to 20+ years;  
* serves as part of ecological network enabling the spread of species, the variability of biotopes;    
* serving as a security buffer against nitrogen leakage from intensively managed arable parcels along water bodies and vulnerable vetland habitats. 

This trend has raised concern within NGOs and national administrations, prompting the need for a deeper understanding of the drivers, spatial extent, and environmental impacts of PG-to-AL conversions. Ministries seek data and tools that can support evidence-based policymaking to balance economic competitiveness with sustainable land management and CAP compliance. To implement really performance-based CAP adjustments, ministries across EU Member States aim to:

* ensure sustainable agricultural productivity while aligning with EU Green Deal targets;  
* prevent irreversible permanent grassland losses by monitoring and regulating land conversions;  
* promote higher value-added agri-food exports without degrading ecosystems or violating CAP greening requirement;.  
* develop data-informed land use governance integrating sustainability with economic, environmental and biodiversity objectives.

Meanwhile, the interest by private market actors such as food corporations and risk management agents such as Banks and Insurers is rising to understand natural value as a key to manage and mitigate physical (climate) risks \- e.g. via Hula Earth, RESTORE, KLIM, InSoil, Farmonaut, Landscape Enterprise Networks for Nestle, Danone, Swedbank, Caixa, BNP Paribas, ING, Swiss Re, Howden Group. The ever increasing availability of EO data combined with ground-truth information allows for a rise in monitoring, reporting and verification activities (dMRV) that can further support large-scale financing developments towards regenerative and biodiversity oriented land management activities in Europe involving wider financial market actors.

## Solution Capability 

The offered NCS tool allows creating and onboarding value-added thematic indicators to provide decision-ready insights for several key stakeholders into:

* the spatial and temporal aspects of Permanent Grassland (PG) conversion  to Arable Land (AL) in Lithuania;  
* estimation of carbon loss resulting from these land use changes;  
* estimation of ecosystem connectivity loss, scaling the vulnerability of the PG ecosystems created by the conversion to arable land of a given parcel ;   
* the scaling of overall biodiversity loss.

The land use change is analysed annually at parcel level on a 1:5000 mapping scale, using the geospatial aid applications (GSA) given by the farmers for the area based Common Agricultural Policy payments. 

Due to the large root surface and microbial activity, natural grasslands act as organic carbon sinks. In case of a single ploughing of grassland increased CO2 emissions is detected compared to the intact permanent grassland. The mean carbon change by converting a permanent grassland to an annual crop can reach a 25-43% decline as compared to native grassland (Potter et al. 2000). After 50 years, the soil carbon content did not regain the level it had reached before the grass was first ploughed up (Burke et al. 1995; Rasmussen et al. 1998). For modelling the carbon loss the Soil Organic Carbon content and Sequestration Potential Map of UN-FAO was used as basic input. 

Grassland parcels converted to arable land are part of a larger ecosystem network, where the ecosystem-connectivity relations and the diversity of land use/land cover had been changed. The loss is scaled by an ecosystem connectivity index of the parcel, based on the variability of neighbouring ecosystems.

## Delivery Process

The following information products are available for the area of Lithuania:   
**Permanent Grassland loss use case** \- covering the entire country : 

* Parcels converted from natural permanent grassland (PG) to arable land (AL) from y2024 to y2025.   
* Estimated carbon loss due to ploughing in t/ha   
* Estimated Euro value of carbon loss.  
* Estimated biodiversity/ecosystem service loss due to ploughing PGs to AL.

**Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) use case,** based on the various FAO predictions \- on a sample zone for grassland and for arable land parcels as separate thematic layers: 

* Existing SOC content {y2025} \[t/parcel\]   
* Annual SOC sequestration potential \[t/y/parcel\]   
* Estimated value of existing SOC content {y2025} \[€/parcel\]  
* Possible SOC content under 20 years of using conventional land management practices  {y2045}  
* Possible SOC content under 20 years of sustainable soil management practices {y2045}

Re-use of these data or taking screenshots of the dashboard for non-commercial use is permitted when the attribution **“© EOX generated using Copernicus Sentinel data”** is added. For other uses, stakeholder-friendly [service subscription plans](#heading=h.ybk6v1dnmkw) are offered. 

The NCS tool allows to visualize the information products as  thematic maps generated on-demand for a customer-selected, geographic Area of Interest (AoI). This map interface makes  the spatial identification of areas of high carbon/biodiversity loss or loss potential very easy.  
Data are calculated with the following settings:

* Unit of Metrics: Calculated metrics are presented at the GSA parcel level.  
* Overlapping Thematics: When GSA parcels overlap with other thematic areas, an area-weighted average is calculated.  
* Statistical Areas: Statistics are available for regional (county, NUTS-3), settlement, and for  agroecological regions.  
* Uncertainty  values delivered by the data custodian are always taken into account, thus a conservative scenario is presented.
